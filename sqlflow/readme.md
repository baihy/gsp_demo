## SQLFlow

SQLFlow is a tool that automates data lineage discovery by analyzing the SQL script.
It generates a nice clean diagram to show the dataflow among the table/view and columns
in the data warehouse.

Support more than 20 major databases including bigquery, couchbase, dax, db2, 
greenplum, hana, hive, impala, informix, mdx, mysql, netezza, openedge, oracle, postgresql, 
redshift, snowflake, sqlserver, sybase, teradata, vertica,

Just paste the SQL script and click a button, you will get the data lineage diagram instantly,
highlight the dataflow in the diagram with a simple mouse click.

You can also call the RESTful API provided by this tool in your own program and 
get the data lineage and diagram model information in a JSON snippet to make further usage.

### How it works

#### SQLFlow architecture
![SQLFlow architecture](sqlflow_architecture.png)

#### SQLFlow backend
1. Receive the SQL script from the frontend and parse the SQL script into parse tree nodes
by utilizing [the GSP library](http://www.sqlparser.com).

2. Analyze the SQL parse tree to generate the data lineage which includes the relationship
of database objects such as table/view and columns used in the SQL.

3. Generate the diagram model of the data lineage which includes nodes and edges that represent the table/view contained
in the SQL.

4. Return a JSON snippet including the data lineage and diagram model to the frontend.


#### SQLFlow frontend
1. Send the SQL script received from the browser in JSON to the backend.

2. After receiving the result which includes the data lineage and diagram model 
generated by the backend, visualize the diagram model in the browser.

3. Highlight the dataflow in the diagram when the user clicks on a specific column.

#### SQLFlow RESTful API

SQLFlow also provides RESTful API, so your program can communicate with the SQLFlow backend directly.
Sending the SQL to SQLFlow backend and receive a JSON snippet including the data lineage and diagram model
for further processing in your own program.
